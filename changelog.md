---

## [2.3.0 - 2.3.1] 2020-12-06

### Added

- Added support for automated dependency management via Hydrate autoinstall to normal and direct deploys


### Changed

- Deploy artifact cleaner now makes a best effort run after every deployment, whether or not it succeeded


### Fixed

- Added missing dependency hydration step to direct deploys
- Fixed inability to deploy static asset-only apps; thanks @thedersen!

---

## [2.2.3] 2020-12-09

### Fixed

- Fixed inaccurate API type specification in certain circumstances

---

## [2.2.2] 2020-12-04

### Changed

- Removed printing unnecessary static asset deploy status
- Updated dependencies

---

## [2.2.1] 2020-11-29

### Fixed

- Fix bug where `NODE_ENV` would not be updated to `production` if `production` environment had no other env vars; thanks @barryf!

---

## [2.2.0] 2020-11-28

### Added

- Moved ASAP + fingerprinting from Package into Deploy (finally)


### Fixed

- Fixed `fingerprint` check that could cause false negative fingerprinting
- Improved reliability of direct deploys; thanks @filmaj!

---

## [2.1.1 - 2.1.2] 2020-11-25

### Fixed

- Fixes env var population when Deploy is run via CLI

---

## [2.1.0] 2020-11-23

### Added

- Added support for custom file paths
- Added support for direct deploys of multiple functions from a single source dir (with custom file paths)
- Added support for direct deploys to production Lambdas
- Added support for ensuring environment variables are updated during direct deploys
- Added support for `ARC_ENV` env var


### Changed

- Implemented Inventory (`@architect/inventory`)
- An inventory object is now passed as the 4th parameter to Macros; please note that this is (for now) considered internal-only and may change in the future
- Shored up AWS region throughout, now defers to `options`, and then Inventory region (which is itself may use `AWS_REGION`)
- Internal change: removed final remnants of old `nested` code path
- Internal change: retiring `dirty` nomenclature / API for `direct`
- Added validation checks for `@http` `any` + `catchall` syntax with legacy `REST` APIs
- Deploy no longer creates missing Lambda resources by default; to reenable that, add to your preferences file:
```arc
@create
autocreate true
```

### Fixed

- Fixed static deployments on apps with enough CloudFormation resources to paginate; fixes #996, thanks @samirrayani!
  - Also fixed direct deployments on apps with enough CloudFormation resources to paginate
- Fixed case where explicitly defining `@cdn false` does not disable the CDN; fixes #968
- Fixed bug where Deploy would crash instead of bubbling a CloudFormation error
- Fixed non-exiting CLI process when an error occurs

---

## [2.0.4] 2020-10-26

### Added

- Added support for CloudFormation's new 500 resource limit! This makes us very happy! You can now ship much larger Architect projects.

---

## [2.0.2 - 2.0.3] 2020-10-15

### Added

- Adds support for symlink-aware hydration, ensures no symlinked shared code will ever be deployed to production

---

## [2.0.1] 2020-10-10

- Added support for `@http` `head` + `options` methods
- Added support for `@http` `any` method syntax (e.g. `any /path`)
- Added support for `@proxy`


### Changed

- Breaking change: with the addition of `@http` `any` and `*`, default `get /` greedy catchall is now deprecated
  - To restore that behavior, either move your `get /` route to `any /*`, or just define a new `any /*` route
- Updated dependencies

---

## [1.9.3] 2020-09-21

### Fixed

---

## [1.9.0] 2020-09-16

### Added

- `HTTP` APIs are the new default when provisioning new API Gateway resources
  - Defaults to `http` setting, which uses the latest payload format, or manually specify `httpv2` or legacy `httpv1` payload formats
    - Apply in CLI with `--apigateway http[v1|v2]`, or in project manifest with `@aws apigateway http[v1|v2]`
  - Added backwards compatibility for `REST` APIs with `rest` setting
    - Apply in CLI with `--apigateway rest`, or in project manifest with `@aws apigateway rest`
  - This only impacts Architect `@http`, which was formerly provisioned as `REST` APIs
  - More info: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/http-api.html
  - Fixes #838


### Changed

- Internal change: implemented new code standard with `@architect/eslint-config`

---

## [1.8.4] 2020-07-15

### Fixed

- Fixed static asset deploy path issue; fixes #915, ht gyan!

---

## [1.8.3] 2020-07-01

### Changed

- Apps now ensure least privilege HTTP methods on `/_static/*`, allowing only `GET`


### Fixed

- Fixed API Gateway issue that adds an extra stage called `Stage`
- Corrected internal configuration for static proxy

---

## [1.8.2] 2020-06-24

### Changed

- Static asset deployments now rely on MD5 hashes for static asset diffing, and not filesystem `mtime`; fixes #890

---

## [1.8.1] 2020-06-23

### Changed

- Update dependencies

---

## [1.8.0] 2020-06-03

### Added

- Rewrite of static asset S3 publishing
- Added the ability to prefix any path to `deploy.static` calls (e.g. `always-upload-to-this-folder/file.html`) with `@static prefix whatever` (or as a parameter in `deploy.static`)
- Enabled `deploy.static` calls to override the default Architect behavior (which always deploys to CloudFormation generated S3 buckets) and specify custom `bucket` and `region` parameters
- Added ability to prune from a full deploy (e.g. `arc deploy --prune`)
- Respect `@static spa` setting in root proxy
- Default root proxy now coldstarts faster by removing any globally defined layers
- `deploy.static` now accepts optional AWS credentials object


### Fixed

- Fixed file pruning for projects with `@static folder` specified
- Now checks to ensure `@static folder` exists, and errors if not found
- Fixes `@static fingerprint ignore` with more recent versions of Architect Parser

---

## [1.7.1] 2020-05-17

### Changed

- Updated direct deployment copy, added warning
- Updated dependencies

---

## [1.7.0] 2020-05-10

### Added

- Deploy can now deploy directly deploy single functions or groups of functions to Lambda by providing a path; examples:
  - `arc deploy src` will dirty deploy all of `./src`
  - `arc deploy src/http` will dirty deploy all of `./src/http`
  - `arc deploy src/events/foo` will dirty deploy `./src/events/foo`
  - As a reminder: direct deployments should be considered temporary / for testing only, and will be overwritten by any deployments coming in from a proper full deploy operation
  - Fixes #625, shout out to @filmaj for this awesome feature! ðŸ”¥

---

## [1.6.1] 2020-04-16

### Added

- Added Sandbox watcher pausing
  - Writes an empty `_pause-architect-sandbox-watcher` file in your operating system's `$TMP` directory (usually `/tmp` or `c:\windows\temp`) which temporarily pauses the Sandbox watcher
  - This means Sandbox can remain open during deploys and neither should interfere with the other
- Allow disabling Architect's CDN checks / processes so user can configure / manage their own CDNS via Macros; fixes #750, thanks @jgallen23!
  - Syntax: `@cdn false` || `@cdn disable` || `@cdn disabled`


### Changed

- Updated dependencies


### Fixed

- Fixed issue where custom named deployments (`deploy --name`) wouldn't work with `static`; fixes #759, thanks @jgallen23!
- Fixed issue where deploying static assets may deploy to the wrong bucket if additional buckets are defined in Macros; fixes #750, thanks @clintjhill + @jgallen23!

---

## [1.6.0] 2020-03-22

### Added

- Added early support for HTTP APIs (currently only via Macro)

---

## [1.5.4] 2020-03-22

### Changed

- Updated dependencies

---

## [1.5.2 - 1.5.3] 2020-03-19

### Changed

- Updated dependencies

---

## [1.5.1] 2020-02-13

### Changed

- Updated dependencies

---

## [1.5.0] 2020-02-05

### Added

- Dry-run flag: `deploy --dry-run`
  - Test your `@macros`, function hydration, CloudFormation / SAM template files, and other deployment-related operations without actually building any live infra
  - Dry-run mode runs through all deploy operations necessary to generate your app's CloudFormation / SAM template files
  - **Heads up:** the AWS CLI requires a live, active S3 bucket to generate your app's templates; however no **live infra will be created** from these templates


### Changed

- Updated dependencies

---

## [1.4.0] 2020-01-13

### Added

- If no deployment bucket is specified, Deploy now automatically creates one for you
  - If a deployment bucket was automatically created before, but no longer exists (or access is no longer available), a new bucket will be created and your app's configuration will be updated
  - This also means the `@aws` pragma is no longer stricly necessary to deploy to AWS with Architect
