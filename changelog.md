# Architect Deploy changelog

---

## [1.5.0] 2020-02-05

### Added

- Dry-run flag: `deploy --dry-run`
  - Test your `@macros`, function hydration, CloudFormation / SAM template files, and other deployment-related operations without actually building any live infra
  - Dry-run mode runs through all deploy operations necessary to generate your app's CloudFormation / SAM template files
  - **Heads up:** the AWS CLI requires a live, active S3 bucket to generate your app's templates; however no **live infra will be created** from these templates


### Changed

- Updated dependencies

---

## [1.4.0] 2020-01-13

### Added

- If no deployment bucket is specified, Deploy now automatically creates one for you
  - If a deployment bucket was automatically created before, but no longer exists (or access is no longer available), a new bucket will be created and your app's configuration will be updated
  - This also means the `@aws` pragma is no longer stricly necessary to deploy to AWS with Architect
