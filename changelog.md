# Architect Deploy changelog

---

## [4.2.8] 2023-01-05

### Added

- Deploy now respects `ignore` patterns when pruning files that may only be in S3 and not on the local filesystem
  - Example use case: upon completion of deployment, you have a separate process for publishing an artifact to your app's static asset bucket; adding that artifact's name, folder name, etc. to `@static ignore` will now ensure it will not be destroyed with `@static prune` enabled

---

## [4.0.0 - 4.0.2] 2022-01-13

### Added

- Architect 10 plugin API support!
  - Added `deploy.start` methods for CloudFormation mutation and other arbitrary pre-deploy operations

  - Added `deploy.target` methods for deploying Architect projects to other targets
  - Added `deploy.end` methods for running arbitrary post-deploy operations
- Added `--eject` option (functionally the same as `--dry-run`)


### Changed

- Breaking change: moved legacy API Gateway REST API provisioning to `@architect/plugin-rest-api` plugin; to continue deploying REST APIs with Architect:
  - Install `@architect/plugin-rest-api` to your project's dependencies
  - Add `@plugins architect/plugin-rest-api` and `@aws apigateway rest` to your project manifest
  - Fixes #1297
- Breaking change: removed `--apigateway` CLI flag + `apiType` property from the module API
  - The preferred way to configure your API Gateway is now the `@aws apigateway` setting in your project manifest
- Breaking change: bare CLI arguments (e.g. `deploy production`) as aliases to flags are now discarded, please use CLI flags (e.g. `deploy --production` or `deploy -p`)
- Breaking change: you must now use an individual CLI flag (or let your shell auto expand) for each of multiple tags or direct deploy Lambdas; examples of adding the tags `foo` + `bar`:
  - Multiple flags: `deploy --tag foo --tag bar`
  - Short flags: `deploy --t foo --t bar`
  - Shell-expanding: `deploy --tag={foo,bar}`
- Breaking change: `-d` CLI flag will now be used for debugging, not direct deployments
- Breaking change: the `deploy.dirty` API method is now fully deprecated, please use `deploy.direct` instead
- Internal change: moved most internal CloudFormation mutations into Package (where they rightly belong), via the `deployStage` param
- Internal change: refactored deployment operation order
- Upgraded CloudFront HTTPS TLS protocol to `TLSv1.2_2021`
- Migrate static bucket permissions from per-object ACLs to a bucket policy so users can customize the static bucket permissions using macros
  - See: https://github.com/architect/package/pull/148, https://github.com/architect/deploy/pull/350
- Stop publishing to the GitHub Package registry

---

---

## [1.9.0] 2020-09-16

    - Apply in CLI with `--apigateway http[v1|v2]`, or in project manifest with `@aws apigateway http[v1|v2]`
  - Added backwards compatibility for `REST` APIs with `rest` setting

### Changed

- Update dependencies

---

## [1.8.0] 2020-06-03

### Added

- Added the ability to prefix any path to `deploy.static` calls (e.g. `always-upload-to-this-folder/file.html`) with `@static prefix whatever` (or as a parameter in `deploy.static`)
- Enabled `deploy.static` calls to override the default Architect behavior (which always deploys to CloudFormation generated S3 buckets) and specify custom `bucket` and `region` parameters
- Added ability to prune from a full deploy (e.g. `arc deploy --prune`)
- Respect `@static spa` setting in root proxy
- Default root proxy now coldstarts faster by removing any globally defined layers
- `deploy.static` now accepts optional AWS credentials object


### Fixed

- Fixed file pruning for projects with `@static folder` specified
- Now checks to ensure `@static folder` exists, and errors if not found
- Fixes `@static fingerprint ignore` with more recent versions of Architect Parser

---

## [1.7.1] 2020-05-17

### Changed

- Updated direct deployment copy, added warning
- Updated dependencies

---

## [1.7.0] 2020-05-10

### Added

- Deploy can now deploy directly deploy single functions or groups of functions to Lambda by providing a path; examples:
  - `arc deploy src` will dirty deploy all of `./src`
  - `arc deploy src/http` will dirty deploy all of `./src/http`
  - `arc deploy src/events/foo` will dirty deploy `./src/events/foo`
  - As a reminder: direct deployments should be considered temporary / for testing only, and will be overwritten by any deployments coming in from a proper full deploy operation
  - Fixes #625, shout out to @filmaj for this awesome feature! 🔥

---

## [1.6.1] 2020-04-16

### Added

- Added Sandbox watcher pausing
  - Writes an empty `_pause-architect-sandbox-watcher` file in your operating system's `$TMP` directory (usually `/tmp` or `c:\windows\temp`) which temporarily pauses the Sandbox watcher
  - This means Sandbox can remain open during deploys and neither should interfere with the other
- Allow disabling Architect's CDN checks / processes so user can configure / manage their own CDNS via Macros; fixes #750, thanks @jgallen23!
  - Syntax: `@cdn false` || `@cdn disable` || `@cdn disabled`


### Changed

- Updated dependencies


### Fixed

- Fixed issue where custom named deployments (`deploy --name`) wouldn't work with `static`; fixes #759, thanks @jgallen23!
- Fixed issue where deploying static assets may deploy to the wrong bucket if additional buckets are defined in Macros; fixes #750, thanks @clintjhill + @jgallen23!

## [1.5.1] 2020-02-13

### Changed

- Updated dependencies

---

## [1.5.0] 2020-02-05

### Added

- Dry-run flag: `deploy --dry-run`
  - Test your `@macros`, function hydration, CloudFormation / SAM template files, and other deployment-related operations without actually building any live infra
  - Dry-run mode runs through all deploy operations necessary to generate your app's CloudFormation / SAM template files
  - **Heads up:** the AWS CLI requires a live, active S3 bucket to generate your app's templates; however no **live infra will be created** from these templates


### Changed

- Updated dependencies

---

## [1.4.0] 2020-01-13

### Added

- If no deployment bucket is specified, Deploy now automatically creates one for you
  - If a deployment bucket was automatically created before, but no longer exists (or access is no longer available), a new bucket will be created and your app's configuration will be updated
  - This also means the `@aws` pragma is no longer stricly necessary to deploy to AWS with Architect
