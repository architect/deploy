> Architect serverless framework module for deploying applications to cloud infrastructure

[![GitHub CI status](https://github.com/architect/deploy/workflows/Node%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/architect/deploy/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Node+CI%22)


## Installation

    npm i @architect/deploy
    let deploy = require('@architect/deploy')


## Requirements

You need to have the `sam` command-line utility available on your `$PATH`. Check out [AWS' docs][sam-cli] for instructions on how to install this.


## API

### `deploy.direct({ isDryRun, srcDirs }, callback)`

Deploys function code directly to one or more staging (or production) environment Lambdas _by ommitting CloudFormation and directly updating code payloads_. This is very useful for live debugging; changes made with direct deploys should be considered temporary.


### `deploy.sam({ verbose, production }, callback)`

Deploys all infrastructure associated to your @architect app.

Set `verbose` to truthy to enable chatty mode. By default will only push to the staging environment unless `production` is truthy.


### `deploy.static({ bucket, credentials, fingerprint, prefix, prune, region, verbose, production }, callback)`

All parameters are optional.

Pushes static assets from the `public/` folder of @architect apps to S3, as defined by your @architect app's `.arc` file. Respects `fingerprint` (`true` or `external`), `prefix`, `prune`, and `ignore` params or `@static` pragma directives (more information available on the [`@static` arc guide][static-guide]).

By default will only publish to the staging environment unless `production` is truthy. Set `verbose` to truthy to enable chatty mode.

### `aws-sdk` caveat

Deploy requires `aws-sdk`; earlier versions included `aws-sdk` in `peerDependencies`, which prior to npm 7 would not automatically install `aws-sdk`. This is because Architect assumes you already have `aws-sdk` installed via Architect, or that it's available at runtime if you're using Deploy in a Lambda.

However, npm 7 (once again) changed the behavior of `peerDependencies`, now automatically installing all `peerDependencies` (instead of merely printing a reminder). This means any Lambdas that use Deploy would get a >50MB dependency payload if deployed on a machine with npm 7.

As such, please ensure `aws-sdk` is installed to your project or globally to your machine. We are sorry to make this a userland issue, but we feel this is preferable to unnecessarily and invisibly causing `aws-sdk` to be double-installed in Lambdas, negatively impacting coldstart times and adding to bug vectors.
